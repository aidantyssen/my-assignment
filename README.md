</p>
<p>My mum and dad both migrated to Australia when they were young, my mum from Argentina and my dad from Singapore, so I have many nationalities such as Chinese, German, Lithuanian and Dutch.  I completed my year 12 studies in 2020 and am now a first year at RMIT studying bachelor of Information Technology. In my past time I love swimming, looking after my plants, gaming and exercising. </p>
<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
<p>My interest IT started last year, my sister got a boyfriends who studied IT and through it he’s able to make great income at an early age and also has great flexibility in his job, allowing him to live a balanced life and spend time doing things he enjoys.  This was inspiring for me as I’d love that kind of lifestyle, and played a large role in choosing to study Information Technology. 
I don’t have much experience in IT. In high school I chose basic programming as an elective and over ten weeks I learnt how to use scratch. I learnt basic skills and by the end of the program I had completed a few small projects such as making a simple website and a game of pong. 
I chose to come to RMIT because out of all the open days I attended, RMIT seemed most welcoming and seemed like they prepared their students exceptionally for future jobs. RMIT’s system of finding real work experience for students was very alluring to me. This type of programming would build a lot of confidence in finding a job after completing my studies and would really prepare students for real jobs.
During my studies I expect to learn many skills such as programming, building websites and app development to help meet the needs of users. I also expect to develop teamwork skills through working with classmates which will prepare me for future work.
I’m interested in IT as there is such large growth in the industry. There are so many new job opportunities opening up with great pay, making IT a very secure profession. </p>
<h2>My Ideal Job  </h2>
<p>This position involves analyzing software and finding possible flaws in the system or ways that its security could be breached. It also involves communicating with teams to explain the problem and come together to secure the software and prevent potential threats. This position is appealing to me as I think that the security of data is extremely important and providing security and protecting people’s privacy would be fulfilling. This position also averages a high salary which is extremely appealing to me, as having financial stability is important to me.
This job requires skills in scanning for vulnerabilities in advanced networks, hacking skills which can be used to find weaknesses in systems and in depth knowledge on the use of Nessus. Extensive knowledge and experience in coding is also necessary, with backgrounds in languages such as Python, Java and JavaScript. At least two years of experience in a similar field is also necessary. Though not explicitly stated, a master’s degree in Cyber security is likely required.  
Currently I have basic skills in programing using Python, scratch and SQL and no qualifications. My only experience in IT is a basic programing elective during high school and approximately a month of experience learning the basics of Python and SQL. 
To get the qualifications for this position, first I must complete the bachelor of information technology, with a GPA of at least 2.0 out of 4.0, which would allow me to enroll in Master of Cyber Security at RMIT. After completing the Master of Cyber Security I would have the necessary qualifications. After obtaining my qualifications I’d get experience in the field, working in cyber security in similar jobs as advertised. In doing so I’d familiarise myself with the type of job, while developing key skills such as scanning networks for weaknesses. In order to have all my skills adequate for this job, as well as completing my studies, I’d put in extra time, learning new programming skills and practicing hacking. I could also increase my programming skills and experience by joining extra activities such as the RMIT programing club, where I could learn from others and gain knowledge from likeminded people.
