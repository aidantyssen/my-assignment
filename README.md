<p>My mum and dad both migrated to Australia when they were young, my mum from Argentina and my dad from Singapore, so I have many nationalities such as Chinese, German, Lithuanian and Dutch.  I completed my year 12 studies in 2020 and am now a first year at RMIT studying bachelor of Information Technology. In my past time I love swimming, looking after my plants, gaming and exercising. </p>
<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
<p>My interest IT started last year, my sister got a boyfriends who studied IT and through it he’s able to make great income at an early age and also has great flexibility in his job, allowing him to live a balanced life and spend time doing things he enjoys.  This was inspiring for me as I’d love that kind of lifestyle, and played a large role in choosing to study Information Technology. 
I don’t have much experience in IT. In high school I chose basic programming as an elective and over ten weeks I learnt how to use scratch. I learnt basic skills and by the end of the program I had completed a few small projects such as making a simple website and a game of pong. 
I chose to come to RMIT because out of all the open days I attended, RMIT seemed most welcoming and seemed like they prepared their students exceptionally for future jobs. RMIT’s system of finding real work experience for students was very alluring to me. This type of programming would build a lot of confidence in finding a job after completing my studies and would really prepare students for real jobs.
During my studies I expect to learn many skills such as programming, building websites and app development to help meet the needs of users. I also expect to develop teamwork skills through working with classmates which will prepare me for future work.
I’m interested in IT as there is such large growth in the industry. There are so many new job opportunities opening up with great pay, making IT a very secure profession. </p>
